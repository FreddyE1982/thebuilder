# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution. Please follow these guidelines:

- **Code style**: keep one purpose per class or function and avoid functions outside of classes. Inherit where sensible and prefer extending existing code instead of creating new versions.
- **Testing**: add or update unit tests for all changes and ensure `pytest` passes.
- **Database**: persist all data in the SQLite database and avoid mock patches in tests.
- **Pull requests**: describe the change and reference related TODO items.
