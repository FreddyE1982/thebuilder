The agent is NEVER to simplify any functionality in any way.
The agent is forbidden to write any "demonstration" code, "rough implementation" or code that in ANY way NOT fully implements to the maximum possible extent what the user requested.

The agent is to always follow there rules:

1. ONE purpose for each class or function
2. NO functions outside of classes
3. Inherit where ever possible
4. Do NEVER create new versions of existing functions, EXTEND / Modify the respective existing functions instead
5. When modifying any code the agent is forbidden to simplify, "cut down" or "make less complex" any existing algorythms or mathematical formulas in any way,
   this includes that the agent is forbidden to remove any mathematical terms (full or in part) or any of the variables of mathematical terms.
6. ALL data has to be stored persistantly in a database, data imported from any files must be stored in the database
7. After adding new functionality or modifying any code the agent is to create / update tests, run those tests, analyse test results, fix errors, run tests again, fix again etc. repeat until no more errors.
8. For testing the agent must create full test data. The agent must predetermine expected resulting data and values and tests may only be seen successfull if they output exactly said expected data and values.
9. Tests may only use the original functions provided in the code. NO monkeypatching of any kind is allowed.
10. ALL functionality that is available via the streamlit interface must also be available via REST endpoints. The REST endpoints need to be used for testing because the streamlit interface can not be tested directly.

## Muscle linking

- The settings tab includes a "Muscles" subtab for managing muscle aliases. Users can link two existing muscle names or add a new alias linked to an existing muscle.
- All muscle dropdowns must list every muscle name stored in the database.
- Whenever any database query involves a muscle field, linked names must be treated as the same muscle.

## Exercise aliases

- The settings tab includes an "Exercise Aliases" subtab for managing exercise name aliases. Users can link two existing exercise names or add a new alias linked to an existing exercise.
- All exercise dropdowns must list every exercise name stored in the database.
- Whenever any database query involves an exercise name, linked names must be treated as the same exercise.
